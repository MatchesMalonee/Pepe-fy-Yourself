# Pepe-fy Yourself


## What is it?
Brought to you by OpenCV's C++ API, this is a small demonstration/proof of concept of OpenCV's face detection capabilites. Compile and run to bring up a window with webcam output and every detected face replaced by a happy Pepe face!

The compiled binary must always be located in the same directory as the 'resources' folder.

## Dependencies
- A properly installed OpenCV's C++ API.

## Notes
When compiling, please ensure that the include paths and paths to the dynamic libraries are available and valid, or else risk a compile/link error.
